<b>Programming Paradigms in JavaScript </b>: JavaScript is a mutli-paradigm programming language, supporting <b>Imperative Programming</b> along with <b>Object Oriented Programming (OOP)</b> and <b>Functional Programming</b>

<i>Prototypal inheritance</i>, <i>this</i>, are parts of OOP.<br>
<i>Closures</i>, <i>first-class functions</i> are parts of Functional Programming.

<b>Functional Programming</b> is characterized by one thing: the absence of <i>side-effects</i>. It doesn't rely on data outside the current function, and it doesn't change data that exists outside the current function.

<b>Avoid Side-effects:</b> Side-effect is anything that function might do that isn't computing it's output from the input that you have given and returning that output.

<b>Pure Functions:</b> taking an input and doing things only with that input and nothing else and returning the output.

<b>Higher-Order Functions:</b> taking other functions as input, or returning functions as output.. simply put treating functions as objects.
